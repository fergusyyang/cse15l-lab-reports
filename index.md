# Lab Report Week 7

## Part 1

We chose to complete task 1 from the week 6 lab. 

The shortest vim command of our group is 

```vim<space>D<tab><enter>/start<enter>cebase<esc>n.n.:wq<enter>```

We first used the terminal command ```vim<space>D<tab><enter>``` to access the java file ```DocSearchServer.java```.

After that, we write ```/start``` to search for the keyword ```start```.

Enter ```cebase``` to change the parameter ```start``` to ```base```.

Then we hit <esc> to exit the input mode.

We repeat the above process by entering ```n.n.``` and change the other two ```start``` to ```base```.

Then we use ```:wq<enter>``` to save and exit.
