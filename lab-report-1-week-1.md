In week 1 lab, we will learn about how to log into student account on ieng6, using VScode.

First we need to install [VScode](http://code.visualstudio.com/).
Make sure to download the correct version for your computer (Windows/Mac).

Open VScode. In the tool bar, select Terminal - New Terminal to open a terminal in VScode.

Enter ssh cs15lfa22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu

(replace "zz" with your account letter, for example, mine is iv)

Enter the password to connect with ieng6
